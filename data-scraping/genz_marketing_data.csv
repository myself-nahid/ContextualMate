Whether you have two or ten people on your social media team, managing social media marketing entails overseeing a number of channels and moving parts. Effective social media project management helps social media marketing teams of all sizes organize and manage the various aspects of social media marketing.including: Campaign planning: Campaign planning is the first step in any social media project. This process necessitates collaboration between social media teams, marketing teams, and business leaders to align social media campaigns with broader marketing goals and overall business objectives, as well as careful consideration of campaign goals, target audience, targeted social media platforms, content types needed, contributors needed to create the content (copywriters, graphic designers), and campaign execution timeline. Content ideation: Every social media marketing team relies heavily on content ideation to generate engaging campaign and post ideas. Tools and processes for managing the ideation process and capturing ideas from team members and external resources are included in effective social media project management. For example, some social media teams capture ideas using Trello boards, shared Google Sheets, or similar tools, with periodic meetings to brainstorm and refine ideas for future campaigns. Creative asset development: Because social media marketing relies on both written and visual content, systems and processes for creative asset development are essential components of social media project management. Graphic designers, videographers and video editors, and copywriters handle these tasks, but having a clearly defined process for assigning those tasks and ensuring that https://genzmarketing.xyz/assets/frontend/assets are developed and approved on time is essential for seamless campaign execution. Asset library: An asset library is a central repository that stores images, photos, videos, and written content. Having a repository full of on-brand, approved https://genzmarketing.xyz/assets/frontend/assets and product images allows marketers to quickly locate the https://genzmarketing.xyz/assets/frontend/assets they require to keep campaigns on track. Tools with user access controls and permissions enable social media managers to grant team members access to the https://genzmarketing.xyz/assets/frontend/assets they require while avoiding the risk of non-approved or rights-managed https://genzmarketing.xyz/assets/frontend/assets being misused. Content calendar:A social media content calendar is the foundation of any successful social media campaign, providing a visual method for scheduling posts across the increasing number of social media networks that today's marketers manage. Social media managers can keep campaigns on track by using an organized social media content calendar. It also fosters transparency, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and is aware of what is coming up next. Workflows and approvals:To keep the entire team on track, clearly defined workflows allow teams to establish who is responsible for which tasks and set deadlines for creative asset drafts and approvals. Campaigns are less likely to be delayed due to miscommunication or not receiving drafts or approvals on time when workflows and task management are defined. Post scheduling:With the best days and times to post on social media varying by platform, staying on top of posting at the right times on each network is a difficult task. Social media scheduling tools are the most commonly used tools in the arsenal of a social media project manager, allowing marketers to draft and schedule posts weeks in advance to ensure that your campaigns never miss a beat. Social media listening and monitoring:Social media listening is another important aspect of social media project management that involves monitoring social media networks for comments on posts, brand mentions, product mentions, questions, and direct messages, all of which are opportunities to respond and engage your audience. Social media listening can also be used to conduct competitive analysis. Paid campaigns:Today's social media advertising opportunities range from social commerce posts that allow customers to make purchases seamlessly to sponsored posts, offer ads designed to drive conversions, and more. If you plan to use paid social media advertising as part of your campaign, you should have well-defined processes in place for creating ads, determining your budget, managing ad campaigns, and tracking results. Measurement and reporting: Monitoring analytics is a continuous process that allows teams to identify the most effective campaigns and tactics for engaging audiences on social media platforms.

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started Cold Email Marketing Home Services Cold Email Marketing Competitive Analysis Social Media Campaign Contents & Copywriting Social Media Management Video Advertisement and Animation Cold Email Marketing Coaching & Training PR & Communications Cold Email Marketing GenZ has a dedicated cold email application for our clients to design and send emails. Either you can register yourself with a monthly service plan, or we will run the end-to-end service for you with our dedicated account managers and executives. Email marketing is the key resource for engaging more clients in a short time. Additionally, it enables you to get more leads and sales. What is Cold Email? A cold email is one sent to someone with whom you have no prior relationship. Cold emails serve a legitimate business purpose and make relevant offers to targeted prospects, which distinguishes them from spam. Except for the medium, there is little difference between a cold email and a cold call. (And cold emailing is usually much easier at scale.) In both cases, you're contacting a stranger, establishing a personal connection, and attempting to achieve a business-related goal and if the outcome is clearly beneficial to your recipients as well, chances are you'll be successful. We administrate different types of cold emails campaigns based our clients necessaty and each of them has its way of tergating customer and success. Commencing Introductory email. Sale or promotional email. Hard sale cold email. Soft sale cold email. Social Media cold email. Name Drop or reference cold email. Request help or ask for advice cold email. Offer free help cold email. The call to action, or CTA cold email. Commencing Introductory email WThis is based on the premise of introducing yourself to the recipient, as the name suggests. You may be tempted to sell your product or service, similar to how a marketer is trained to do during a cold call. Although it would be simple to work in a ""soft sell,"" this is not what you want. Resist the temptation. This email aims to strengthen relationships and please remember that you're not stepping in for the sale right now. Simply introduce yourself, provide more information about yourself, and begin the process of making business acquaintances in this cold email. If everything goes as planned, such as a follow-up email or social media connection, you can continue to nurture and advance the relationship. Sale or promotional email A Sale or promotional email email can help you gain the confidence you need. It is all about persuading someone to make a purchase in the near future. You are not sending this cold email to develop a relationship over time. You do it because you want to make a sale as soon as possible. Businesses can advertise their goods and services by sending out promotional emails. Promotional emails often aim to turn subscribers into customers and existing customers into brand champions as opposed to transactional emails, which tell customers about their order or account information. A Sale or promotional email strategy will never be completely successful, but there are things you can say to increase your open and response rates. There are many types of promotional email categories among them, GenZ follows the follofing categories: Limited-Time Offers Sales Promotion Emails Subscriber-Special Offers Product Launch Emails New Arrival Emails Seasonal Campaigns Giveaway Emails Hard sale cold email Exuberant excitement is a common characteristic in hard-sell presentations, with the goal being to make the prospective buyer appear just as enthused about the product as the salesperson. They are frequently stuffed with information designed to overwhelm a customer with all the advantages of buying the suggested product. For instance, a car salesman will frequently list all the ""extra"" or ""luxury"" features of a car in an effort to make purchasing the automobile seem almost irresistible. A hard-sell strategy is often used to convince customers to buy a product on the basis of logic by providing them with several justifications for why or how using the product will enhance their lives. For instance, the salesperson could give arguments such how owning the product will save the customer time, how it is simpler to use, and how it is less expensive than a similar product. Soft sale cold email The hurry and emphasis on making an immediate purchase that define a hard sale are conspicuously absent from a soft sell. In contrast to the hard sell practise of providing various facts and logical justifications for purchasing a product, it also tends to be a more emotive presentation. Additionally, compared to a hard sell, a soft sell makes far fewer overt attempts to close the deal. In fact, some soft sell ads are so deceptive that there isn't even a clear attempt to convince the buyer to buy the product. Although the advertisement may go into great detail about the product, it doesn't make any direct sales pitches beyond listing the stores or websites where the product can be purchased. Would you immediately push your product or service if you attended a conference or spoke with someone on the phone? Most likely not. Even if you believe you can make a sale, it may cast a negative light on you. Instead, you begin by introducing yourself and then give a soft pitch about yourself and your company. Although email differs from in-person or phone conversations, it is often preferable to avoid hard sell tactics in favor of something more informative. If you find a good soft sell email, you can use it to start the conversation. This will eventually lead to you feeling more confident in asking for the sale. Test it in your email campaign and see how it goes. Social Media cold email When you combine the best of social media and email, the results of your email campaign can be spectacular. There are opportunities to incorporate this into your cold email strategy regardless of your preferred social media platform. This email serves two functions: To introduce yourself in response to a social media request. To ensure that the person has your email address, which can help speed up the process of scheduling a phone call or meeting later on. It is not possible to respond to every social media request with an email. This isn't something you'll do every time, but it's a strategy to use when you really want to build a relationship with someone while also experimenting with your email campaign. Name Drop or reference cold email Do you know anyone who knows someone who knows someone? When prospecting for new business, your network can provide numerous advantages. Some consider name dropping to be a deadly strategy, while others believe it is impolite. If you want to give it a shot, a cold email is the way to go. The truth is that mentioning your name increases your credibility. The individual believes you because they know someone in your network. Furthermore, because of who you know, the person is more likely to respond to your email. Name dropping can significantly improve the response rate of your cold email strategy. If you named the person in the subject line of your email. This will result in a higher open rate. Request help or ask for advice cold email When you combine the best of social media and email, the results of your email campaign can be spectacular. There are opportunities to incorporate this into your cold email strategy regardless of your preferred social media platform. Even the world's greatest business minds seek assistance from others. They are aware of their flaws and are not afraid to enlist the assistance of others. Inquiring for advice via email can help you build a relationship. The person may be flattered that you approached them for assistance. This gives you a strong foundation for moving the conversation forward. This email is short, sweet, and to the point. You ask two direct questions, expecting two direct answers. If you're lucky, the person will give you useful advice. If you're really lucky, they might even volunteer to answer a phone call, provide detailed feedback, or even provide you with personal assistance as a mentor. In this case, the ideal response would be something like, ""Can you send me your proposal and/or manuscript for review?"" Even if this does not occur, any response is a step in the right direction. Request help or ask for advice cold email If you consider yourself an expert on a particular subject. You can provide free advice to prospects by leveraging your expertise. We understand you have a lot on your plate. We know you have a lot of work to do. However, offering free advice now could lead to a lucrative deal later on. It is simple to put together this type of email. You must include the following components: Introduction outlining your area of expertise. The type of free assistance you are providing. A method of providing assistance. Establishing a relationship can be facilitated by requesting advice in an email. The fact that you asked for assistance may have made them feel honoured. You now have a firm foundation on which to further the dialogue. The call to action, or CTA cold email The call to action, or CTA, is one of the most crucial elements when developing an email marketing campaign. A call-to-action email button piques a subscriber's interest and prods them to take action. CTAs are a crucial component of an email marketer's toolkit. The difference between good and exceptional emails may be found in these straightforward but effective buttons because an email, regardless of the campaign it is utilised in, should continue a dialogue or engagement between a business and a customer. An email should contain at least one CTA to encourage interaction, whether a brand is sending out a newsletter, thanking a user for a purchase, or reminding a customer about their full cart. Despite being necessary, these buttons are not always the simplest components to embed. There are many types of CTAs like Shop now, Shop our fall collection, Shop now. Get 50% off., Shop our best sellers, Act now, Save toda,y Buy now, Buy now. Pay later., Buy it today,  etc. Email marketing is the key resource for engaging more clients quickly. Additionally, it enables you to get more leads and sales. With GenZ cold email marketing, you can get the ultimate success to attract new clients. Try GenZ!

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started Social Media Campaign Home Services Social Media Campaign Competitive Analysis Social Media Campaign Contents & Copywriting Social Media Management Video Advertisement and Animation Cold Email Marketing Coaching & Training PR & Communications Social Media Campaign GenZ researches and understands your market to prepare the Social Media Campaign. Our dedicated LinkedIn Manager will check the performance of each campaign to understand the market and audience reach. We will change our tactics each time to grow and reach more people. What is a social media campaign? A social media campaign is a coordinated marketing effort that uses one or more social media platforms to reinforce or assist with a business goal. Campaigns differ from everyday social media efforts in that they are more focused, targeted, and measurable. Determine your social media goals Determine the current social media status of your organisation Know and understand your audience Choose the appropriate channel Plan and well design your content Decide when and how often to post Plan accordingly Measure your progress and adjust your strategy Step 01: Determine your social media goals The goal of  competitor analysis is to equip you with insights to inform your product development and marketing decisions. The first stage in designing your social media strategy is determining your objectives. Maybe you want people to know more about your brand. Or maybe you want to create customer relationships, boost traffic to your website, sell your items, or share special deals. Choose two or three top priorities and concentrate on how you'll use social media for accomplishing them. Whatever your objectives, be sure they are SMART: time-bound, specified, measurable, achievable, and realistic. Establish your success metrics. If you wish to increase sales leads, for instance, specify a 20% increase. Establish a target number of posts per day or per week and decide how many likes, shares, or comments you want for each one if you want to increase exposure to your company or product. Step 02: Determine the current social media status of your organisation If your company already employs social media, evaluate how well it is currently serving your needs using the objectives and criteria you established in Step 1. Are your objectives being met? If so, you might want to think about raising the bar. If not, the moment has come to determine why. Consider the platforms you are utilising. Even if you just have a small amount of time to dedicate to social media, you don't have to be present on every single one. Finding the areas where you are most successful and concentrating your efforts there is significantly preferable. Step 03: Determine the current social media status of your organisation Next, evaluate whether your posts are accomplishing your goals. Do your posts reach your intended audience, or are they being ignored? Analyse your site and post traffic using analytics to see which content kinds are most and least popular. Step 04: Choose the appropriate channel In Step 2, you will have already begun considering the platforms you want to employ. Now think about whether they fit the profile of your audience. You'll have the most potential reach on LinkedIn. However, if you offer services to business professionals, you could wish to establish a presence on other social media. On the other hand, if you work in the interior design, fashion, or another ""lifestyle"" area, Pinterest or Instagram might be more fruitful. Step 05: Plan and well design your content No matter how many social media platforms you join or posts you write, you won't be able to keep your audience's attention without quality content. Your material should be adapted to the platform you are using as well as reflect the general voice and market of your company. Each sort of social media has its own characteristics and demands, from online culture to the number of characters in a post. Consider where you want to place your brand. Are you trying to entertain or educate your audience? Are a blog article or white paper more likely to elicit a response from your audience than an image or infographic? The audience you're trying to reach is probably swamped with content from other businesses and your rivals. Always strive to create material that is interesting, relevant, and deserving of their attention. They won't read it if you aren't going to take time out of your busy day to do it! Remember that there are various theories regarding what functions best. It's important to observe what your successful competitors are doing on social media, including the platforms they utilise, how frequently they post, and their vocal tone. Examine their habits and modify them for your business. But test out several forms of content instead of just going with your soul on this. Step 06: Decide when and how often to post There is no ideal time that works for every organisation, so choosing when to post requires a great deal of subjectivity. When you post, let your audience be the driver. Determine when they are most active and likely to be interested in interacting with you by keeping an eye on their online behaviours. If your audience is international, you might want to plan postings at different times of the day to accommodate different time zones. You must also choose how frequently to post. You run the danger of ""spamming"" your followers and losing them if you publish too frequently. You could lose business if you don't update frequently enough to attract their attention. Trial and error is the best method to choose the proper frequency. Reduce the quantity of postings if you are posting 15 times per day and are losing followers. Post more frequently, on the other hand, if you just post once per day and don't attract followers. Consistency is crucial; posting erratically can give the impression that you're unreliable or disorganised. You can use an editorial calendar to plan out your pieces and keep track of information like deadlines, networks, content types, keywords, titles, and status. Microsoft Excel may be used to make a straightforward calendar. But the more specific your timetable, the more unified your social media plan will be. Step 07: Plan accordingly It takes time and effort to implement a social media plan, so unless you have a lot of free time, think about hiring someone to assist you. A designated social media manager or your team as a whole may be in charge of establishing and maintaining your social media presence. But whoever you involve, make sure they are aware of the type of online presence you are attempting to build and provide them with the instruction required to publish and update in your personal tone. If blogging is a part of your plan, be sure that it is written and edited by professionals; otherwise, you run the danger of damaging your brand. Making scheduled articles is only one aspect of maintaining an online presence; you also need to cultivate relationships. As a result, be sure to allot enough time to read your followers' comments and answer to them. Step 08: Measure your progress and adjust your strategy The social media world moves quickly. It's critical that you always evaluate and reevaluate how your plan is working because what's popular now will be obsolete tomorrow. Utilise site statistics, such as Facebook Insights, to track your progress towards your objectives and see how specific postings are doing. However, resist the need to focus all of your efforts on gaining more followers, likes, and shares. High levels of engagement are beneficial, but keep your strategy concentrated on the connection between your activities and your corporate objectives. Engagement will reveal how well your material is received by your audience, but it is insufficient to generate income. Find techniques to gauge, for instance, how many leads you received from social media or how many people noticed your sponsored LinkedIn ad and visited your company website. If you want to optimise your business’s social media to make it the best it can be, look no further than GenZ. Our experience means you’ll get creative, engaging posts which will resonate with your business and your following. try GenZ!

How to conduct insightful workshops and training seminars? Workshops and training are popular, but they aren't always memorable, even when your audience is learning something new and the pandemic has caused an epidemic of Zoom fatigue. Many people find it difficult to listen to others drone on. But, thankfully, you can deliver memorable workshops and training seminars with just a little knowledge. We administrate different types of cold emails campaigns based our clients necessaty and each of them has its way of tergating customer and success. Polish your message. Connect with your group. Promote and facilitate discussion. Take into account different learning styles. Remember to have fun! Maintain contact with your attendees. Do not push for perfection. Here are some pointers for delivering memorable workshops and training seminars: Polish your message You can refine the message you want to deliver once you know who your audience is. This will be your event's overarching theme, which will inform the topic. Write down in two or three sentences what you want attendees to learn, think, and feel when they come to your event. Then, make sure that everything you do is in line with that goal. Connect with your group Before the event, network and get to know your attendees. Send out a survey with the event registration form, asking them what questions they need answered. That way, when they show up for your event, you'll know more about them and be able to tailor your presentation to their specific needs Tell a story rather than lecturing. If you want people to remember your workshop, training, or seminar, you must first understand your audience, then know your topic before focusing on relationship building and sharing your and their stories. Instead of approaching the event as if you were a teacher, imagine yourself as someone telling a story and setting the stage for your audience. When you can incorporate a story into what you want them to learn, they are more likely to remember it - especially if they are a part of it. Promote and facilitate discussion. Don't limit yourself to a monologue. Make it a two-way conversation. When you interact with your audience more, they tend to remember more. With encouragement and back-and-forth participation, ask them questions, let them answer, and guide them through your story and the lessons you want them to take away from your presentation. Take into account different learning styles. When planning your presentation, keep in mind that there will be a variety of learning styles. Some people learn well by listening to a lecture, but the majority of people require stimulation and demonstration. Making the event more hands-on will help to include all types of learners. ICF-accredited coach certification programs can help you improve your coaching skills and learn how to start an online coaching business. Remember to have fun! Workshops, training, and seminars can all be enjoyable. Everything does not have to be solemn all of the time. Even at business events, you can have fun while speaking. Of course, depending on your audience, you want to maintain a level of professionalism, but you don't have to be all business all the time. Maintain contact with your attendees. The follow-up to any event is what makes it memorable. How do you keep the people who attended your event engaged over time? Set up a follow-up email sequence with the next event's date for pre-registration, or send them an offer to purchase your online course or 1-on-1 coaching packages. Building long-term relationships will go a long way toward assisting you in hosting memorable events and increasing your event profits. Do not push for perfection. Don't be concerned if things don't go perfectly the first time. The most important thing is to add value to your audience's lives. Even if only five people attend, that's five people who will tell their friends about what they learned and who taught them. Maintain contact with your attendees.

Even if you have an audience in mind when planning online events, you must go above and beyond to laser-focus your audience on a whole new level so that your materials are meaningful to the audience. Determine the topic and theme of your event. Before you begin event planning, you should know what the topic and theme of your event will be. This will assist you in determining the size of the event, the cost, and a variety of other factors related to event planning and promotion. Determine which webinar software you will use. After you've determined your budget, decide on the software you'll use to host your event. The webinar software you use will be determined by the number of attendees and whether the event will be free or paid. From free and low-cost options like YouTube and LinkedIn Lives to Zoom, there are many excellent software options for hosting group coaching events. Professional group coaching software options are available that include advanced features such as replays and can even assist you in turning your event into an online course. Establish your budget Now that you've determined your topic and the software you intend to use, it's time to set a budget for the event.

Whether you prefer to join other people's LinkedIn groups or create your own, you can find some helpful event marketing tips on LinkedIn. Make your marketing materials You'll need to create marketing materials before you can start promoting your online workshop or webinar. Ideally, you should outsource your social media marketing to a professional who can design an event website, online event registration, social media pages, and any other marketing materials required to run ads online and offline. Publicise your event online Advertise for signups a few weeks before the event. You can precisely target your audience with LinkedIn Ads, but you can also look to other avenues for spreading the word about your event. Stay active on the social platforms you've created to educate, inform, and engage your audience and let them know about your workshop while you're working on your marketing.

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started PR & Communications Home Services PR & Communications Competitive Analysis Social Media Campaign Contents & Copywriting Social Media Management Video Advertisement and Animation Cold Email Marketing Coaching & Training PR & Communications PR & Communications GenZ’s public relations (PR) and communications help our enterprises, nonprofits, or public institutions to manage all media and communication channels to develop, preserve, and manage our client's reputations. How we help businessess with PR? When you first started your business, you most likely received a lot of advice on how to market and advertise it. Most likely, such suggestions ignored a different but complementary way to tell your company's story: public relations, or PR. Many people find it difficult to listen to others drone on. But, thankfully, you can deliver memorable workshops and training seminars with just a little knowledge. When you run a public relations campaign, you get free media coverage, social media mentions, and in-person engagements. The only person you could hire is a publicist, who would not pay people to cover you because it is unethical. However, you can do your own public relations - and in some cases, for free. Here's how (and why) you should do your own public relations. Brand awareness on a limited budget. More effective marketing and advertising. More effective permanence. What exactly is PR and how it can help you get more customer? PR, or ""public relations,"" is the strategic communication with the public to establish and build a positive image and reputation for your company. It usually consists of obtaining press coverage, social media posts, and in-person engagements. In the event of negative press about your company, public relations can also include crisis communication. Typically, public relations entails someone else telling your story and, in some cases, interviewing you to do so. Marketing, on the other hand, entails promoting your products directly to your target audience through email newsletters, online content, SEO, and other means. The important thing is that you or someone you hire creates and distributes these materials. One distinction between marketing and advertising is that the latter requires payment for priority placement in areas where people look for products and services. The Advantages of Public Relations Public relations can help your small business in the following ways: Brand awareness on a limited budget: When the media covers your company because it is newsworthy or because you are an expert, it generates free publicity for your product or services. While paying for media coverage is typically unethical, sponsored content - a type of advertising - provides a lower-cost opportunity to gain attention. Just make it clear that the content is subsidised. If you want people to remember your workshop, training, or seminar, you must first understand your audience, then know your topic before focusing on relationship building and sharing your and their stories. More effective marketing and advertising:  Public relations is not the same as marketing or advertising, but it is an excellent complement to both. Consider this: everything is interconnected. Wouldn't you look into a company you'd never heard of if you saw a bunch of ads for it? Then, if you found a lot of positive press about the company, you'd be more likely to buy from them. More effective permanence: Ads eventually outlive their paid period of high visibility, and all marketing campaigns come to an end. However, the media you obtain through public relations does not go anywhere. This media could be found through any internet search related to your brand, products, or services. That means there are numerous opportunities to engage customers with your story. Our dedicated team will help you to get your stories published in national, local, and international newspapers and all sorts of mainstream publications. Try GenZ!

He is driven, extremely intelligent, passionate about his work and how he can make it deliver change for humanity, and in everything he does, puts integrity first. Rebecca Leopard CMO, Upgrading Women UK I highly recommend Dr Shah Siddiqui as a mentor to anyone seeking guidance and support in navigating the challenges of entrepreneurship as an immigrant, person of colour, or neurodiverse individual. Shah's wealth of experience and expertise, combined with his compassionate and supportive approach, make him an invaluable resource for anyone looking to achieve their business goals and overcome obstacles along the way. He truly embodies the spirit of resilience and determination, and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with him. Naomi Smy Operational Hub Lead, Solent LEP Shah has dedicated himself to supporting our Enterprise Adviser roles across the Solent region. This role essentially connects education and industry together for the good of young people and helping to prepare them for the world of work. This is achieved by working with schools in a strategic way and developing/enhancing Careers education and guidance. Shah has been an inspiration since he started, networking with other Enterprise Advisers, supporting events and sharing his own personal experiences and challenges. Jack Smith Property investor, Jack Property Services Shah has been a massive help to me in building my business and the website he has made for me is going to play a big part in building the business. He also helps out a lot of students at Portsmouth University with their business and I'm grateful for him doing so. Clair Martin Founding Director, Seekers Create C.I.C Dr Shah is a kind and clever person who has overcome many life challenges. He is highly motivated and dedicated to making a positive change in our community. I enjoy working with Dr Shah and believe he will succeed. 1 2 3 4 5 Testimonials What Our Clients Say We have many happy clients who are delighted with our service and we have included some of their

Creating a workplace culture focused on employee well-being encourages higher-performing employees and serves as input into overall organisational success, while supporting and promoting wellness. Fostering a humanistic approach to work contributes to an organisational climate that includes people, helps organisations develop resilience, and fuels productivity. Optimal wellbeing can result from making investments in employee health, such as encouraging employees to engage in physical activity, getting appropriate sleep for better concentration, and achieving better mental wellbeing. Additionally, there are wellness initiatives available, as well as increased flexibility of working hours.

      3 months ago Upvote Here's how you can cultivate workplace resilience with business coaching. The more resilient leaders prepare in advance for what might come in relation to technological advances, economic shifts, demographic changes, and dynamic transformation of the workforce. So that they diminish uncertainty and fear. Supporting a shift in mindsets in this way catalyses a culture that’s more receptive to new ideas, methodologies, and problems. Encouraging evolution like this brings about more change-engaged teams, allows leaders to nimbly navigate the intricacies of transformation, and enables them to participate actively in the transformation process. Therefore, if the business leaders are not open to embracing new skills, it will hinder the capabilities to be the change and enhance capacity.

      3 months ago Upvote Here's how you can cultivate workplace resilience with business coaching. Survival and progress in a competitive and rapidly moving corporate world require agility. Adaptable executives consider change an inevitable aspect of running a company and welcome it. Appealing to agile leadership first focusses on this recognition of change, then encourages a mindset shift to foster innovation and growth in the organisation: Agility in leadership begins first with a recognition that change is constant. It can also be useful to encourage a mindset shift, such as in business coaching, to move people towards having a growth orientation.

      3 months ago Upvote Here's how you can cultivate workplace resilience with business coaching. Trust in a team is crucial for a leader to lead effectively. Trust in oneself is essential for guiding the team through the complexities of human interactions and life events. A leader's confidence in their decision-making, thoughtfulness, and resilience to adversity are crucial for trust. To establish self-trust, leaders should respect themselves, expand their emotional toughness, communication, and decision-making skills regularly. Consistency in action increases reliability, creating a predictable and stable foundation. Showing vulnerability, being open and honest about difficulties, making mistakes, and admitting when you don't know something, shows humility and honesty, which are essential for building trust with the team.

      3 months ago Upvote You're grooming junior employees for success. How can you empower them to reach new heights? A great way to empower the junior staff is through giving them autonomy. By giving them decision-making authority, problem-solving opportunities and project management responsibilities within their capacity, we allow priceless on-the-job experience which short-circuits their careers and supports their slow but steady climbing up the hierarchy chart. Their level of self-confidence gains momentum and they become more adept in handling commitments that lie ahead. In addition, through this way of giving autonomy, their capability of making decisions and problem solving is also enhanced. By giving them your trust and autonomy, you are instilling a growth mentality and growing your company’s future leaders.

      4 months ago Upvote You're grooming junior employees for success. How can you empower them to reach new heights? The first step in empowering junior employees is giving them the tools they need to succeed. Ensuring people have the resources they need is critical for their development, whether that's access to specialised training programmes, insightful reading materials, or chances to communicate with diverse departments. Providing them with these tools will increase their worth to the company and their self-assurance. Their potential is turned into expertise through this investment in their progress, which drives success for both individuals and organisations.

#Economy #Education #UK 5 Global Regulatory Insights The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into Education Software Solutions Ltd (ESS), the leading provider of management information systems for schools. With a market share of approximately 50% in England and even higher in Wales and Northern Ireland, ESS is suspected of potentially abusing its dominant position to hinder schools from switching to competitors.

What’s the issue?

- Schools have reported difficulties in transferring their essential data to new providers, alleging that ESS claimed such actions would infringe on its intellectual property rights.
- Alternatives for data extraction offered by ESS are considered complex, time-consuming, and prone to errors.

Why it matters: Management information systems are crucial for handling sensitive student data and ensuring operational efficiency in schools. The ability for educational institutions to freely choose and switch their software providers is essential for fostering a competitive market and innovation.

#GCSEResults #ResultsDay 5 Dante AI By leveraging AI chatbots, schools in England are pioneering the future of learning.

AI chatbots are revolutionizing education, making it more efficient and effective by creating tailored learning experiences; providing administrative assistance; and teaching digital literacy—ensuring every student has the resources they need. 

One example is Cottesmore School in the South East of England, which built an AI head teacher to work alongside the human head to provide advice and support, ensuring both teachers and students receive the help they need. Students even design their ideal tutors with AI, creating personalized learning experiences.

At Dante AI, we support the future of education by building AI chatbots that can power these personalized learning solutions—giving teachers and students the support and resources they need. 12 Show more posts Show fewer posts Explore collaborative articles We’re unlocking community knowledge in a new way.

Creating a workplace culture focused on employee well-being encourages higher-performing employees and serves as input into overall organisational success, while supporting and promoting wellness. Fostering a humanistic approach to work contributes to an organisational climate that includes people, helps organisations develop resilience, and fuels productivity. Optimal wellbeing can result from making investments in employee health, such as encouraging employees to engage in physical activity, getting appropriate sleep for better concentration, and achieving better mental wellbeing. Additionally, there are wellness initiatives available, as well as increased flexibility of working hours.

      3 months ago Upvote Here's how you can cultivate workplace resilience with business coaching. The more resilient leaders prepare in advance for what might come in relation to technological advances, economic shifts, demographic changes, and dynamic transformation of the workforce. So that they diminish uncertainty and fear. Supporting a shift in mindsets in this way catalyses a culture that’s more receptive to new ideas, methodologies, and problems. Encouraging evolution like this brings about more change-engaged teams, allows leaders to nimbly navigate the intricacies of transformation, and enables them to participate actively in the transformation process. Therefore, if the business leaders are not open to embracing new skills, it will hinder the capabilities to be the change and enhance capacity.

      3 months ago Upvote Here's how you can cultivate workplace resilience with business coaching. Survival and progress in a competitive and rapidly moving corporate world require agility. Adaptable executives consider change an inevitable aspect of running a company and welcome it. Appealing to agile leadership first focusses on this recognition of change, then encourages a mindset shift to foster innovation and growth in the organisation: Agility in leadership begins first with a recognition that change is constant. It can also be useful to encourage a mindset shift, such as in business coaching, to move people towards having a growth orientation.

      3 months ago Upvote Here's how you can cultivate workplace resilience with business coaching. Trust in a team is crucial for a leader to lead effectively. Trust in oneself is essential for guiding the team through the complexities of human interactions and life events. A leader's confidence in their decision-making, thoughtfulness, and resilience to adversity are crucial for trust. To establish self-trust, leaders should respect themselves, expand their emotional toughness, communication, and decision-making skills regularly. Consistency in action increases reliability, creating a predictable and stable foundation. Showing vulnerability, being open and honest about difficulties, making mistakes, and admitting when you don't know something, shows humility and honesty, which are essential for building trust with the team.

      3 months ago Upvote You're grooming junior employees for success. How can you empower them to reach new heights? A great way to empower the junior staff is through giving them autonomy. By giving them decision-making authority, problem-solving opportunities and project management responsibilities within their capacity, we allow priceless on-the-job experience which short-circuits their careers and supports their slow but steady climbing up the hierarchy chart. Their level of self-confidence gains momentum and they become more adept in handling commitments that lie ahead. In addition, through this way of giving autonomy, their capability of making decisions and problem solving is also enhanced. By giving them your trust and autonomy, you are instilling a growth mentality and growing your company’s future leaders.

      4 months ago Upvote You're grooming junior employees for success. How can you empower them to reach new heights? The first step in empowering junior employees is giving them the tools they need to succeed. Ensuring people have the resources they need is critical for their development, whether that's access to specialised training programmes, insightful reading materials, or chances to communicate with diverse departments. Providing them with these tools will increase their worth to the company and their self-assurance. Their potential is turned into expertise through this investment in their progress, which drives success for both individuals and organisations.

#Economy #Education #UK 5 Global Regulatory Insights The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into Education Software Solutions Ltd (ESS), the leading provider of management information systems for schools. With a market share of approximately 50% in England and even higher in Wales and Northern Ireland, ESS is suspected of potentially abusing its dominant position to hinder schools from switching to competitors.

What’s the issue?

- Schools have reported difficulties in transferring their essential data to new providers, alleging that ESS claimed such actions would infringe on its intellectual property rights.
- Alternatives for data extraction offered by ESS are considered complex, time-consuming, and prone to errors.

Why it matters: Management information systems are crucial for handling sensitive student data and ensuring operational efficiency in schools. The ability for educational institutions to freely choose and switch their software providers is essential for fostering a competitive market and innovation.

#GCSEResults #ResultsDay 5 Dante AI By leveraging AI chatbots, schools in England are pioneering the future of learning.

AI chatbots are revolutionizing education, making it more efficient and effective by creating tailored learning experiences; providing administrative assistance; and teaching digital literacy—ensuring every student has the resources they need. 

One example is Cottesmore School in the South East of England, which built an AI head teacher to work alongside the human head to provide advice and support, ensuring both teachers and students receive the help they need. Students even design their ideal tutors with AI, creating personalized learning experiences.

At Dante AI, we support the future of education by building AI chatbots that can power these personalized learning solutions—giving teachers and students the support and resources they need. 12 Show more posts Show fewer posts Explore collaborative articles We’re unlocking community knowledge in a new way.

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started Factors that Affect Portfolio Allocation Home Blog Factors that Affect Portfolio Allocation Marketing 07 March 2023 By Mahzabin Akter Factors that Affect Portfolio Allocation Portfolio allocation refers to the process of distributing an investment portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, to achieve a balance between risk and return. There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure. – â€“ Paul Tournier Risk tolerance: Investors with a higher risk tolerance may allocate more of their portfolio to high-risk, high-return assets like stocks, while investors with a lower risk tolerance may prefer lower-risk, lower-return assets like bonds. Investment goals: The goals an investor has for their portfolios, such as long-term growth or income generation, can also influence portfolio allocation. For example, an investor seeking long-term growth may allocate more to stocks, while an investor seeking income may allocate more to bonds. Time horizon: The time horizon an investor has for their portfolio can also impact portfolio allocation. A longer time horizon may allow for a more aggressive allocation to stocks, while a shorter time horizon may call for a more conservative allocation to lower-risk assets. Market conditions: Market conditions, such as the current economic environment, interest rates, and the performance of specific sectors, can also influence portfolio allocation. For example, a favourable economic environment may lead to a higher allocation to stocks, while a weaker economy may lead to a higher allocation to bonds. Diversification: Diversification is the practice of spreading investments across multiple assets to minimize risk. Investors may allocate their portfolios to a mix of asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to achieve diversification. Tax considerations: Tax considerations may also impact portfolio allocation. For example, investors may allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s to minimize tax liability. Investment constraints: Finally, investors may face investment constraints that limit their ability to allocate their portfolios in certain ways. For example, a pension fund may be required to allocate a certain percentage of its portfolio to bonds to meet its obligations. Overall, the factors that affect portfolio allocation are numerous and complex, and investors should carefully consider each factor when constructing their portfolios.

Marketing 07 March 2023 By Dr Shah Siddiqui Is brand engagement necessary? Brand engagement refers to the process of forming an emotional or psychological connection between a brand and its customers. This connection is fostered through consistent, meaningful interactions that encourage customers to actively participate in the brand's narrative and offerings. In the era of globalisation and market proposition, brand engagement is crucial for a business to succeed in global competition. – â€“ Dr Shah Siddiqui Emotional connection: Building an emotional connection between your brand and your customers is crucial for brand engagement. Customer loyalty: Brand engagement can lead to increased customer loyalty, which can result in repeat purchases, referrals, and positive reviews. Positive brand reputation: Engaged customers are more likely to share positive feedback about your brand, which can help to improve your brand reputation and increase your visibility. Consistency: Consistency is key when it comes to brand engagement. Diversification: Diversification is the practice of spreading investments across multiple assets to minimize risk. Investors may allocate their portfolios to a mix of asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to achieve diversification. Measurement: Measuring your brand engagement metrics regularly is important for tracking progress and making adjustments as needed. In today's competitive market, where consumers have countless choices, brand engagement has become a pivotal factor for businesses . It distinguishes brands in crowded markets, creates loyal customer bases, and enhances overall customer experience, making it a crucial element for long-term business success. While brand engagement may not be universally necessary, it plays a crucial role in driving business success, customer loyalty, and competitive advantage in many industries. Understanding Brand Engagement A. Definition and Components of Brand Engagement Brand engagement encompasses the development of an emotional connection between a brand and its audience. This connection is built through various components, including: Emotional connection: Brands strive to evoke emotions such as joy, trust, or excitement in their customers, fostering a deeper bond. Customer interaction: It involves meaningful interactions between the brand and its customers, whether through social media engagement, customer service interactions, or experiential marketing. Brand loyalty: Successful brand engagement results in customer loyalty, where individuals consistently choose a particular brand over its competitors, often due to the emotional connection and positive experiences they've had. B. Differentiation from Other Marketing Concepts Brand engagement differs from other marketing concepts such as brand awareness and customer satisfaction in its focus and outcomes: Brand awareness primarily concerns making consumers aware of a brand's existence and offerings, whereas brand engagement emphasizes fostering a deeper connection beyond mere recognition. Customer satisfaction revolves around meeting customer expectations and delivering quality products or services, whereas brand engagement aims to go beyond satisfaction to create loyal advocates who actively engage with and promote the brand. Arguments Against the Necessity of Brand Engagement A. Industry-specific Relevance Commodities and Low-engagement Products: In industries where products are perceived as commodities or low-involvement items, the necessity of brand engagement may be questioned. Consumers may prioritize convenience or price over brand loyalty. B2B Markets: In business-to-business (B2B) markets, where purchasing decisions are often based on rational factors like cost-effectiveness and functionality, the emotional connection fostered by brand engagement may have less impact. B. Cost and Resource Implications Small Businesses and Start-ups: For small businesses and start-ups with limited budgets and resources, investing in extensive brand engagement initiatives may not be feasible. They may prioritize immediate revenue-generating activities over long-term brand-building efforts. Return on Investment Concerns: There may be concerns about the tangible return on investment (ROI) of brand engagement strategies, especially in industries or situations where the effects are difficult to measure or where results may take time to materialize. C. Alternative Strategies Price Competition: Some argue that in highly price-sensitive markets, competing solely on price may be more effective than investing in brand engagement efforts. Consumers may prioritize cost savings over brand loyalty. Product Innovation: Instead of focusing on building brand engagement, businesses may opt to differentiate themselves through continuous product innovation, providing unique features or benefits that attract customers without necessarily relying on emotional connections. In conclusion, we have explored the significance of brand engagement in driving business success, customer loyalty, and competitive advantage. We discussed how brand engagement involves fostering emotional connections, meaningful interactions, and brand loyalty. Additionally, we examined arguments against its necessity, considering industry-specific relevance, cost implications, and alternative strategies.

My mother was the only supporter and understood a little before puberty. She used to say to concentrate on what you can do good and you will find your way forward very easily. I found my strength to perform well in education, and my results were satisfactory before secondary education and attempted three times to pass the exam. I did not know what was wrong with me and was in jeopardy with my family and surroundings. Then I came into higher education in the Uk and sometimes later discovered that the Brain tumour was the reason for not remembering things and other complications. Neurodiversity is not a disability for many of us; it is a way to think and work differently with extreme success. – Dr Shah Siddiqui I took a long break and started my education again as I was unsatisfied with my situation. Although that was laughter for many around me, I did not listen to them. Completed my BSc in engineering and Master of research with first class. Later found my saviour Prof. Adrian Hopgood to finish my PhD in AI. I have always struggled throughout my life being an introvert, and due to my health, I suffer from many other disabilities. Did not get a job with an interview. Employers intend to misjudge me for my neurodiversity and other disabilities; even holding a Doctorate, my success in securing a job is limited. The interview process and the experience are not suitable for me, and it is very stressful. Therefore, I have come up with the idea to form the Neurodivergent Business Consortium (NBC) and the first person I named Cora Burke, to join this initiative. Together we are developing initiatives (brainchild) to help people with neurodiversity. Today we had our first event and have many well-wishers to support this initiative. Our team is growing we have Penny Plimmer, Rebecca Leppard, Jack Smith, Dr Beatriz Lopez, Dr Steven Kapp, Dr veronica Sprott, and many others to raise our voices toward neurodiversity. We had Penny Mordaunt MP (Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons) as our chief guest, Lord Mayor of the Portsmouth City Council Cllr. Hugh Mason as Honorable Guest, Jon Adams FRSA as a panel member. Thank you to all the guests who have made this event successful, including Shipa Ahmed Khan, Raja Ali, Rowshonara Reza, Dr Madalina-Daniela Mihailescu, Becky Warren, Amy Butler, Clair Martin, Jon Scowen, Tom Swaffer, Mark Rands, Helen Stratton MBA FCIM, Habibur Rahman, Jane Lamer, Joseph Gamlin, Steve Baker, and Thomas Hutchinson.

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started Improve your Social presence through Social media management Home Blog Improve your Social presence through Social media management Marketing 07 March 2023 By James Buckley Improve your Social presence through Social media management Social media management involves the management, optimization, and monitoring of a business's social media presence across various platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and others. The goal of social media management is to create and maintain a strong online presence for the business, engage with customers and followers, build brand awareness, and drive traffic and conversions. By effectively managing their social media presence, businesses can build relationships with customers, increase brand loyalty, and drive revenue growth. Social media is transforming our business paradigm massively and we need to keep up-to-date with our tactics to be a game changer. – Dr Shah Siddiqui Social media management can provide several benefits for businesses. Here are some of the key benefits:: Increased brand awareness: Social media management can help businesses to increase their brand awareness and reach a wider audience. By regularly posting and engaging with followers, businesses can build a strong online presence and increase their visibility. Improved customer engagement: Social media provides businesses with a platform to engage with their customers and followers in real time. By responding to comments and messages promptly and providing valuable content, businesses can build stronger relationships with their customers. Increased website traffic: Social media can be an effective way to drive traffic to a business's website. By including links to their website in posts and running social media advertising campaigns, businesses can direct more traffic to their site. Better customer insights: Social media management tools can provide valuable insights into customer behavior, interests, and preferences. This information can be used to improve marketing strategies, product development, and overall business operations. Diversification: Diversification is the practice of spreading investments across multiple assets to minimize risk. Investors may allocate their portfolios to a mix of asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to achieve diversification. Competitive advantage: By effectively managing their social media presence, businesses can gain a competitive advantage over competitors who are not investing in social media or who are not optimizing their social media strategies effectively. Overall, social media management can help businesses to build their brand, engage with customers, drive traffic, gain valuable insights, and gain a competitive advantage in their industry.

The goal of social media management is to create and maintain a strong online presence for the business, engage with customers and followers, build brand awareness, and drive traffic and conversions. By effectively managing their social media presence, businesses can build relationships with customers, increase brand loyalty, and drive revenue growth. Social media is transforming our business paradigm massively and we need to keep up-to-date with our tactics to be a game changer. – Dr Shah Siddiqui Social media management can provide several benefits for businesses. Here are some of the key benefits:: Increased brand awareness: Social media management can help businesses to increase their brand awareness and reach a wider audience. By regularly posting and engaging with followers, businesses can build a strong online presence and increase their visibility. Improved customer engagement: Social media provides businesses with a platform to engage with their customers and followers in real time. By responding to comments and messages promptly and providing valuable content, businesses can build stronger relationships with their customers. Increased website traffic: Social media can be an effective way to drive traffic to a business's website. By including links to their website in posts and running social media advertising campaigns, businesses can direct more traffic to their site. Better customer insights: Social media management tools can provide valuable insights into customer behavior, interests, and preferences. This information can be used to improve marketing strategies, product development, and overall business operations. Diversification: Diversification is the practice of spreading investments across multiple assets to minimize risk. Investors may allocate their portfolios to a mix of asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to achieve diversification. Competitive advantage: By effectively managing their social media presence, businesses can gain a competitive advantage over competitors who are not investing in social media or who are not optimizing their social media strategies effectively. Overall, social media management can help businesses to build their brand, engage with customers, drive traffic, gain valuable insights, and gain a competitive advantage in their industry.

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started What is Social media marketing? Home Blog What is Social media marketing? Marketing 02 April 2023 By James Buckley What is Social media marketing? Social media marketing (SMM) is the use of social media- the platforms on which users build social networks and share information to build a company's brand, increase sales, and drive website traffic. Your social media marketing (SMM) approach will be more successful the more specifically you target it. Thereâ€™s no doubt about it; these days, your business needs to be on social media, and you should concentrate at least some of your marketing efforts on your social media strategy. SMM is the simplest way to reach an extensive with 4.48 billion people owning social media accounts, thereâ€™s a whole world of potential customers that any business can access, simply by logging in and creating brilliant content. Using social media to raise brand awareness is quite helpful and half of the world's population are now within the reach of it. Additionally, this figure is continually rising; since 2019, social media usage has increased by 9.2%. 52% of online brand discovery, according to Hootsuite, takes place in open social feeds. In other words, the majority of individuals use social media to discover new products. Social media is transforming our business paradigm massively and we need to keep up-to-date with our tactics to be a game changer. – Dr Shah Siddiqui The Importance of Social Media Marketing for Businesses: Reach specific audiences to build relationships: You have the chance to develop relationships with your clients through social media. Businesses may have only communicated with customers in the past when they were making a purchase or handling a problem. However, using social media gives you the opportunity to interact with customers more personally and establish a rapport that may encourage loyalty and repeat business. It is the perfect time to start using social media to attract new clients if you haven't already. You can use social media to advance your company with a little bit of work through LinkedIn and other mediums. Improved customer engagement: Social media provides businesses with a platform to engage with their customers and followers in real time. By responding to comments and messages promptly and providing valuable content, businesses can build stronger relationships with their customers. Increase brand recognition and trust: Social media is used for product research by 54% of consumers. So, in order to capitalise on users' social media interests, a brand needs to have top-notch accounts on various social networks. Here, potential customers can connect with a brand on their preferred platform. Additionally, providing top-notch service on social media is essential. People anticipate businesses will assist them, and if the support was top-notch, they are happy to recommend the brand to others (71% of users will do so if they had a positive experience with a business on social media). Driving traffic and leads to websites: Social media profiles are essential for establishing and growing a company. A strong social media presence can increase visitors to your website. According to reports, social media is the main driver of traffic to eCommerce websites. Traditional media trails behind social media in terms of bringing visitors to your website. They generate a lot of chances to attract clients and turn them into leads. Increased sales and income: Businesses, whether multinational corporations or sole proprietorships, can use social media marketing to drive sales revenue because it seems obvious to do so. Businesses can also use it to launch recruitment campaigns, offer customer service, engage customers, generate leads, direct followers to the website, and gain insightful data. Of course, there are difficulties when using social media to increase sales because you could attract trolls who constantly point out others' defects, whether they are real or imagined. Poor management of the account could bring shame to the company or harm the brand you are seeking to establish. In order to make a significant impact when using social media for branding or marketing, you must commit to the long haul with social media marketing. Boost client happiness and engagement: Engaging in social media helps you improve your consumer interactions. You have the chance to get to know your consumers and develop relationships with them when they interact with your posts or message you on social media. Give them the information they need, engage in lighthearted banter when appropriate, and go above and beyond to satisfy their needs. Engaging in social media also enables you to develop a devoted customer base. You may improve customer loyalty by being there for your consumers in times of need, getting to know them, and providing a distinctive customer experience. Due to your responses to their inquiries, customers will have faith in your brand. People spent, on average, 2 hours and 24 minutes per day in 2019. The amount of time spent on social media climbed by 1.4%, another growth indication. Because of this, social media is a fantastic tool to communicate with your audience over an extended period of time. Social media platforms have a bigger and bigger role in increasing sales every year. For instance, 43% of internet users in 2019 used social media for product research before purchasing. Even though just 12% of individuals are prepared to click a Facebook or Instagram ""buy"" button, social media is very important in the early phases of the buyer's journey.

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started How Lead Generation Works? Home Blog How Lead Generation Works? Marketing 07 March 2023 By Dr Shah Siddiqui How Lead Generation Works? Lead generation is the process of attracting prospects to your business and increasing their interest through nurturing, all with the end goal of converting them into customers. Some ways to generate leads are through job applications, blog posts, coupons, live events, and online content. When a stranger initiates a relationship with you by showing an organic interest in your business, the transition from a stranger to a customer is much more natural. Lead generation falls within the second stage of the inbound marketing methodology. It occurs after you've attracted an audience and are ready to convert those visitors into leads for your sales team (namely, sales-qualified leads). LinkedIn is the key resource to selling your services and products. It takes ages to understand a target audience. Therefore, hiring an expert like GenZ will increase your sales. – GenZ Admin Letâ€™s walk through the steps of the lead generation process.: First, a visitor discovers your business through one of your marketing channels, such as your website, blog, or social media page. That visitor then clicks on your call-to-action (CTA) â€” an image, button, or message that encourages website visitors to take some sort of action. That CTA takes your visitor to a landing page, which is a web page that is designed to capture lead information in exchange for an offer. An offer is a content or something of value that's being ""offered"" on the landing page. This can be an e-book, a course, or a template. Once on the landing page, your visitor fills out a form in exchange for the offer. Once you put all of these elements together, you can use your various promotional channels to drive traffic to your landing page and start generating leads. But what channels should you use to promote your landing page? Letâ€™s talk about the front end of lead generationâ€”lead gen marketing. The lead-to-customer conversion rate is never 100%. This is why the primary goal of lead generation is to fill the sales funnel with high-quality leads. The importance of getting quality leads is obvious. It helps you: Target the right people. You focus your resources on specific customers who are more likely to buy your product or service. This results in saving time and money, streamlining your companyâ€™s processes, and growing sales. Build brand awareness. Lead generation always entails educating your leads on your company and its productâ€”both when they learn about you on their own and when you reach out to them with information about your productâ€™s features. Leads can then spread information about your brand by word of mouth, bringing you even more clients. Get valuable data. As a rule, generating leads means collecting information about your prospective customers, their wants and needs, and your competitors. This helps you improve your product or service so that it has a competitive advantage in the market. Grow revenue. With an effective lead generation strategy, your company can get 133% more revenue than youâ€™ve planned. Generating leads can be a lot of work, but it pays off. There are many solutions on how to get leads; all you have to do is try to find lead gen channels that are best for you and your business. We recommend you start with lead sourcing, as you can run such lead generation marketing campaigns at no or low cost and get high-quality targeted leads. But donâ€™t be afraid to use email finder tools too. Go and launch your lead generation campaign today, and let GenZ help you on your way to getting quality leads!

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started How to Increase Web Traffic Using LinkedIn? Home Blog How to Increase Web Traffic Using LinkedIn? Marketing 17 April 2023 By Tamanna Turin How to Increase Web Traffic Using LinkedIn? Even though LinkedIn may be delivering a lot of passive and active leads into your funnel, sometimes a prospect still needs to visit your website in order to fully experience what you have to offer in terms of customer service. It's one of the top venues for driving visitors to your website because of this. In this newsletter, we'll look at some of the finest methods for using LinkedIn to improve web traffic and make sure you're taking advantage of all the eyes on your profile. There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure. – Paul Tournier Display Your Website URL in Your LinkedIn Headline Your prospects are more likely to become interested in what you have to offer as soon as they finish reading if you have written an engaging headline for them to read. The benefit of completely optimized LinkedIn headlines is that. They draw interest. Including a link to your website in your headline is one of the easiest strategies to quickly start directing traffic from LinkedIn to your website. Many people will now forego doing this in favour of including their link in their LinkedIn profile. Although it isn't always a terrible thing, adding a short URL to your title does make a lot of sense. LinkedIn Publications It makes sense to syndicate some of your blog pieces to LinkedIn publishing if you routinely write blog entries. It seems reasonable that you might not have enough bandwidth for two platforms with distinct content. It's all right. There is a solution. You can share a portion of your original blog post on your website along with a link to the complete content. In this way, they are already interested in your content, and if they believe it is valuable, they will want to read the rest of it, which will drive traffic to your website. Here's where things start to get serious. Make sure there's more content on your website than just the rest of your peace if you want them to stay on it for a while. So that customers can enjoy exploring your site and you have the chance to improve their purchase intent and provide appropriate linking mechanisms and CTAs. LinkedIn Posts That Add Value Do you want to establish a name for yourself and provide such reliable value that people ""desire"" to visit your website? Well, here's how to use LinkedIn. You contribute. This means that until your target audience feels the need to check out your profile and discover that you have a website, you must post items that are valuable to them. Yet, sporadically posting is never sufficient. If you don't consistently provide value, the momentum you're trying to create will wane. This entails using LinkedIn frequently. It can be challenging to gain traction at first, but if you conduct an audit and acquire a sense of what your audience wants, it gets simpler to write and promote this content. Adding CTAs Leading to Your Website Telling people to visit your website directly is the most straightforward technique to increase traffic to it. This could be done through your postings, LinkedIn profile optimization, or even LinkedIn publications. It's not as simple as just directing visitors to your website to see whatever you post on the platform, though. If you do this too frequently, you come out as spammy and you alienate people, which makes them unwilling to visit your website because you keep urging them to. Give visitors a compelling reason to visit your website if you want them to, whether it's the conclusion of your incomplete LinkedIn article, a webinar you're conducting, or perhaps you just want them to participate in something new that you're doing there. On LinkedIn, keep in mind that less is absolutely more. Syndicating Your Website Posts! Instead of just sharing your blog entries on LinkedIn, check Google Analytics to see which ones are getting the most traffic, then choose those to share with your contacts and followers. They probably will perform well on LinkedIn if they did well on your website. Don't stop there, either. You should create a compelling caption for these images. Ideally, you want something that will pique people's curiosity about the work you're doing and cause them to click on them. That's one approach to enticing guests. As an alternative, if you're organizing a giveaway, have it originate from your website since participants will need to visit there to access what you're offering. It's definitely one of the things that potential customers look at before visiting your actual website. Very likely, they are also looking for the address of your website. You must take advantage of this chance to increase traffic to your website, so be sure to create a corporate profile on LinkedIn to cater to these people. You can even go as far as making showcase pages for these brands if you manage many brands or have a wide variety of distinctive products that are hosted on subdomains or their own unique pages.

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started Instagram Metrics You Should Be Tracking Home Blog Instagram Metrics You Should Be Tracking Marketing 17 April 2023 By Tamanna Turin Instagram Metrics You Should Be Tracking Instagram analytics will give your employees a clear view of how you are performing overall when it comes to updating them during meetings. You'll be in the dark very easily without analytics. But what should you do? We have outlined eight KPIs in this guide that you should be monitoring in order to achieve growth. Change your social media tactics for globalization and to attract more customers with the help of a qualified professional. Remember one true fact you are losing every day many valuable prospects and sales because of your indecision. – GenZ Admin 01. Engagement This indicator will demonstrate the degree to which your content is engaging your viewers. You'll also be able to tell whether it was successful in getting them to your website or business. You can calculate your engagement rate using a formula. Total followers / Total engagement Also, you'll discover that Instagram, like the majority of social media networks, offers stats for both your account and each post. 02. Comments received You want your readers to ""like"" your piece as the first response. Getting them to leave a comment on the piece is the best response, but it can be difficult at times. Those that connect or relate to your material frequently do this. Prioritize looking after these users and keeping them interested. As they continue to leave comments, there is a very strong possibility that more people will see your article. They might begin mentioning their friends in their comments as well. You gain the chance to gain new followers. 03. Follower growth If you think about it carefully, growing your following indicates that you are doing great! You should congratulate yourself on successfully drawing customers to your account. While it is normal for sporadic spikes to occur, particularly if you run a paid advertisement or a significant campaign, your goal should be steady and moderate growth over a set length of time. Seeing this kind of growth on your account shows that users are interested in what they see and want to learn more about what you have to offer. Also, a rising following count indicates the potential audience for your upcoming content. This will undoubtedly have an effect on your upcoming engagements. 04. Impressions This metric will provide you with information on the precise number of individual Instagram users who saw your post. Your organic reach on Instagram will be aided by the platform's algorithm, which is directly correlated with your follower count and the quality of your content. And keep in mind that if your content is very engaging, Instagram may promote it to users who are not currently following you. You'll be helped in developing engaging content if you have an understanding of the types of material that typically draw the Instagram audience in. 05. Reach It can be challenging to gain traction at first, but if you conduct an audit and acquire a sense of what your audience wants, it gets simpler to write and promote this content. 06. Referral traffic In the end, you'd also like to direct your Instagram followers to your website. When your Instagram followers also go to your website, you have a good chance of increasing sales, attracting additional prospects, or just getting a return on your investment. But it presents a problem because the clickable link to your website can only be seen on your bio. Another choice is to include URLs in your captions or create content that is so compelling that viewers will want to visit your website for further details. UTM parameters, which can record data from every user who copies and pastes your link into their browser or sends it to a friend, can be used to track referral traffic. 07. Conversions The only thing that matters in the end is conversions. Do people answer the way you want them to when you ask them to do something? If not, there is something you need to fill in for in order to get them to react as you like. Conversions can take many different forms, including your targets' purchasing your goods, making appointments, sending emails, or signing up. Consequently, a high conversion rate indicates that your material is very effective. High returns could potentially result from effective content. 08. Instagram Stories Some users like to quickly glance through your Instagram Stories to check what has been posted today. Your writing should ideally maintain their interest long enough for them to want to learn more. They will either follow you on your primary account, peruse your postings, or visit your website. You might want to look at the Impressions, Story Exits, Story Responses, and Story Taps Back and Forward to seeing if your Instagram Stories were successful in drawing in viewers. These metrics can help you gain a better understanding of how your audience interacts with the content you deliver to them.

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started What is Return On Investment (ROI)? Home Blog What is Return On Investment (ROI)? Marketing 25 April 2023 By James Buckley What is Return On Investment (ROI)? ROI has become one of the most commonly used investment and profitability ratios today. Return on Investment is commonly known as ROI. Basically, ROI tells you how much money you've made (or lost) an investment or project after accounting for its cost. The ROI in the context of social media marketing is the difference between the cost of social media marketing activities and the resources (time, money, and effort) used in those activities. The purpose of ROI measurement is to identify the effectiveness of a social media marketing campaign and make data-driven decisions to improve future operations. Additionally, ROI aims to quantify the amount of return on a specific investment in relation to the cost of the investment. The most common is net income divided by the total cost of the investment, or ROI = Net income / Cost of investment x 100. Social media is transforming our business paradigm massively and we need to keep up-to-date with our tactics to be a game changer. – Dr Shah Siddiqui Why is ROI important?: ROI measures how much a return on investment compares to the cost of the investment. It is a baseline for developing future marketing plans and is utilised as a part of analytics. This offers you to determine which marketing strategies are effective and which ones could use some improvement By dividing an investment's net profit (or loss) by its initial cost or outlay, ROI is expressed as a percentage. BROI does not account for time passing or the holding duration, which means it may not account for the opportunity costs of investing elsewhere. If there are other opportunities available, it is important to compare whether or not something provides a good ROI. For its wide range of applications, the calculation itself is not overly difficult to understand. If an investment has a net positive return on investment, it probably makes sense. However, these signals can aid investors in excluding or picking the best options if other opportunities with higher ROIs are present. Investors should also steer clear of negative ROIs since they indicate a net loss. The rate of return (RoR), which considers the duration of a project, can be used in conjunction with ROI. Another option is to utilise net present value (NPV), which takes inflation into account when adjusting for changes in the worth of money over time. The real rate of return is a term that refers to the use of NPV when determining RoR.

Home Blog How ChatGPT can help you to write the company and personal content? Content and Copywriting 11 March 2023 By Dr Shah Siddiqui How ChatGPT can help you to write the company and personal content? ChatGPT is one of the most talked about topics in the tech world today. In short, ChatGPT is an AI (artificial intelligence) language model that has been trained to generate text and answer questions. In the future, if this ChatGPT connects to the Internet and updates more, it is believed to be able to beat Google. Nowadays, if we don't know something, we search for it on Google, and Google shows us various information about the searched topic. From there, we have to choose the right one. LinkedIn is the key resource to selling your services and products. It takes ages to understand a target audience. Therefore, hiring an expert like GenZ will increase your sales. – GenZ Admin But ChatGPT is different. It answers questions like a human, so to speak. That means if you ask any question on ChatGPT, you will get the same answer as you would get from an expert on that subject. Suppose you are not good at writing emails. Just ask ChatGPT to write a formal email with your client's name and some basic information. It will help you write beautiful emails in seconds. The rest will depend on your creativity. You can use it to write articles, create video scripts, etc. It can be used to design, write code, write stories, write poetry, science, statistics, etc., just like humans. This ChatGPT presents difficult topics in simple terms. The world is entering the era of advanced artificial intelligence! While this may make life easier, on the one hand, it can also dramatically increase unemployment problems. So there is no way to survive except to increase the speed of the race.

Therefore, hiring an expert like GenZ will increase your sales. – GenZ Admin But ChatGPT is different. It answers questions like a human, so to speak. That means if you ask any question on ChatGPT, you will get the same answer as you would get from an expert on that subject. Suppose you are not good at writing emails. Just ask ChatGPT to write a formal email with your client's name and some basic information. It will help you write beautiful emails in seconds. The rest will depend on your creativity. You can use it to write articles, create video scripts, etc. It can be used to design, write code, write stories, write poetry, science, statistics, etc., just like humans. This ChatGPT presents difficult topics in simple terms. The world is entering the era of advanced artificial intelligence! While this may make life easier, on the one hand, it can also dramatically increase unemployment problems. So there is no way to survive except to increase the speed of the race.

Home About Us Services Portfolio Books Packages Blog Contact Us Get Started Best SEO Agency for Higher Education Home Blog Best SEO Agency for Higher Education SEO 04 July 2024 By Mahzabin Akter Best SEO Agency for Higher Education SEO is crucial for higher education institutions aiming to attract prospective students, engage alumni, and enhance their online presence. As search engine algorithms become more sophisticated, specialized strategies are essential to ensure visibility and relevance. Hiring an SEO agency with expertise in higher education can help institutions navigate these complexities and achieve their goals. This blog post will guide you through the unique SEO needs of higher education, key considerations for choosing the right agency, and a comparative analysis of top agencies in the field. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of how to select the best SEO partner to elevate your institution's online presence. Needs of Higher Education Institutions in SEO Discussion on the Specific Challenges and Opportunities Faced by Higher Education Institutions in SEO Higher education institutions operate in a highly competitive digital landscape. They must balance the need to attract a diverse audience, from prospective students to international applicants, while maintaining a robust online presence. Key challenges include: Competition: With numerous institutions vying for top positions in search engine results, standing out requires a strategic approach. Complex Content: Higher education websites often contain vast amounts of content, from academic programs and admissions information to faculty profiles and research publications. Ensuring this content is SEO-friendly can be daunting. Local and Global Reach: Institutions must optimize for local SEO to attract nearby students while also considering international SEO strategies to reach a global audience. Technical SEO: Many higher education websites face technical SEO issues, such as slow page load times, non-mobile-friendly designs, and complex site architectures, which can hinder search engine rankings. These challenges also present opportunities. By leveraging their wealth of content, institutions can create authoritative resources that attract backlinks and establish domain authority. Furthermore, optimizing for local search terms can enhance visibility in specific geographic areas. Importance of Targeting the Right Audience, Including Prospective Students, Parents, and Alumni A successful SEO strategy for higher education must address the distinct needs of various audience segments: Prospective Students: These individuals are often searching for information on programs, campus life, scholarships, and application procedures. SEO strategies should focus on keywords and content that align with these queries. Parents: Parents often influence the decision-making process. Content tailored to their concerns—such as safety, financial aid, and academic reputation—can improve engagement and conversions. Alumni: Alumni are valuable for maintaining a strong community and securing donations. Optimizing content that keeps them engaged and informed about institutional developments is crucial. Highlighting the Need for Specialized SEO Strategies Tailored to the Higher Education Sector Given the unique nature of higher education, generic SEO strategies are often insufficient. Specialized SEO strategies should include: Content Optimization: Developing high-quality, informative content that answers the specific questions of each target audience. This includes creating detailed program descriptions, student testimonials, and blog posts on relevant topics. Technical SEO: Ensuring the website is mobile-friendly, has fast load times, and employs a logical site structure. Technical audits should be conducted regularly to identify and fix issues. Local SEO: Optimizing for local search terms and ensuring that the institution's Google My Business profile is up-to-date can help attract local students. International SEO: For institutions targeting international students, optimizing content for multiple languages and considering region-specific search behaviors are critical. Authority Building: Engaging in strategies that build domain authority, such as securing backlinks from reputable sources, leveraging social media, and encouraging user-generated content. Key Considerations When Choosing an SEO Agency for Higher Education Expertise and Experience Assessing the Agency's Track Record in Working with Higher Education Clients Review case studies, testimonials, and client references to gauge the agency's success with other higher education institutions. Look for specific examples of achievements, such as increased website traffic, improved search engine rankings, and higher conversion rates. Understanding Their Knowledge of the Unique Needs and Challenges of the Sector Inquire about the agency's familiarity with the higher education industry, including trends, regulations, and audience demographics. Assess their understanding of the challenges faced by higher education institutions in SEO, such as attracting diverse audiences and optimizing complex content. Services Offered Comprehensive SEO Services Tailored to the Needs of Higher Education Institutions Ensure the agency offers a range of SEO services specifically tailored to the needs of higher education, including technical SEO audits, keyword research, on-page optimization, and link building. Look for expertise in optimizing for local and international search, as well as mobile and voice search. Additional Services Such as Content Marketing, PPC, and Social Media Management Consider whether the agency provides supplementary services that can complement SEO efforts, such as content marketing, pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, social media management, and online reputation management. Integration of these services can create a cohesive digital marketing strategy that maximizes results. Transparency and Communication Importance of Clear Communication and Regular Reporting Prioritize agencies that emphasize transparent communication and provide regular updates on the progress of SEO campaigns. Request detailed reports that track key metrics, such as website traffic, keyword rankings, and conversion rates, and explain any changes or recommendations. Evaluating the Agency's Transparency in Their Processes and Methodologies Seek clarity on the agency's SEO methodologies, including their approach to keyword research, content optimization, and link building. Ensure the agency adheres to industry best practices and avoids any black-hat SEO tactics that could harm your institution's reputation. Budget and Pricing Understanding Pricing Models and Ensuring Alignment with Budgetary Constraints Discuss pricing models with the agency, whether it's based on hourly rates, project fees, or retainer agreements. Determine whether the agency's pricing aligns with your institution's budget and ROI expectations. Avoiding Agencies That Offer Unrealistically Low Prices or Promise Guaranteed Results Be wary of agencies that offer exceptionally low prices, as they may lack the expertise or resources to deliver effective results. Avoid agencies that promise guaranteed results, as SEO outcomes are influenced by numerous factors and cannot be guaranteed.

Avoiding Agencies That Offer Unrealistically Low Prices or Promise Guaranteed Results Be wary of agencies that offer exceptionally low prices, as they may lack the expertise or resources to deliver effective results. Avoid agencies that promise guaranteed results, as SEO outcomes are influenced by numerous factors and cannot be guaranteed.

For Customers The best LinkedIn Lead generation services that will help to outlaw your limitations. FAQs Most Frequent Question What separates this process from other types of marketing? Permission-based marketing and relationship building are central to our strategy. Because we build this from the beginning on LinkedIn, the appointments are much more qualified, and our clients consistently receive four to six leads per month. Which LinkedIn profile do you use? We take over one or two of your LinkedIn accounts and manage them on your behalf. You'll have approved all of the messages we send, and because LinkedIn emails you when you get a response, you'll be able to see everything we do, making it completely transparent. What kind of outcomes should I anticipate? We would typically expect at least one qualified appointment with hot prospects in month one, two to three qualified appointments with more hot prospects in month two, and four to six qualified appointments with more hot prospects in month three and beyond. How long until I see a return on my investment? Remember that we're getting appointments with difficult-to-reach decision makers, so it's likely that they'll need board approval before proceeding with you. As a result, the majority of our clients see a return on investment within six months of working with us. However, if you are dissatisfied at any time, you may terminate your employment with us by giving us one month's notice. How certain are you that you can deliver the results I seek? We wouldn't be doing ourselves any favors if we worked with you despite knowing we couldn't deliver the results you desired. If we weren't confident, we would have told you on the first phone call, so if we've gotten this far, we're pretty sure. Do you provide a guarantee? Yes, we do, and here's why. We guarantee that we will meet your target within a quarter. If we do not, we will work for FREE until we catch up with the leads we have contractually committed to. Can a meeting be easily rescheduled if I am unable to attend? If you are unable to attend a meeting that you have scheduled with us or with a client, please contact us as soon as possible so that we can reschedule another date and notify the client. What exactly is GDPR? The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that establishes guidelines for the collection, storage, and processing of personal information from European Union residents (EU). The UK regulator in charge of the Data Protection Act 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 is the Information Commissioner's Office. The ICO is like the data protection police, and we must always stay on their good side. GDPR compliance must be taken seriously because the penalties for non-compliance are punitive and designed to be painful. What impact does GDPR have on marketing? Most marketing formats now heavily rely on the use of customer data. GDPR is a set of rules that govern the circumstances and manner in which data can be legally processed. It also introduces some frightening consequences for breaking the law. The GDPR also establishes a framework for determining which types of data are considered private and should be treated as such. The GDPR-savvy term for private data is Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The amount of PII stored within most businesses' systems astounds them, often without any specific intent or purpose. Does GDPR require consent for marketing? No, not always. The GDPR regulates how we collect, store, and process personal data. Consent is one of the lawful bases for processing personal data under GDPR, but there are others. You may be able to use 'legitimate interests' to justify collecting, storing, and processing personal data in particular. When it comes to data use for marketing purposes and consent issues, the relevant framework is actually PECR. B2B marketing communications regulations are generally less stringent under PECR, and consent is not required in B2B scenarios. You must exercise caution in terms of who you target and the types of messages you send, but that is where we come in; our approach is 100% GDPR AND PECR compliant Naomi Smy Solent Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) Shah has dedicated himself to support our Enterprise Adviser roles across the Solent region.
